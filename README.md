# Basic Thing For Timing Stuff

Use it at: <https://asgrim.github.io/visible-timer/>

 - Pre-timer for random 3-7 seconds
 - Time for number of seconds entered
 - Short links for 10, 20, 150 seconds
 - High visibility colours instead of obnoxious timer sounds
 - Short beep to indicate start/stop

## Setting Up

Ensure jekyll and bundler are installed with `gem install jekyll bundler`,
then install the website dependencies with `bundle install`.

## Running

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and the website should start running at
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
